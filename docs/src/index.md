# RobotDynamics.jl

Welcome to `RobotDynamics.jl`! This package is dedicated to providing a convenient interface
for defining the dynamics of forced dynamical systems, such as robots.

This package also provides many efficient methods for evaluating dynamics, their Jacobians,
and their discrete-time versions for use in optimization packages such as
[TrajectoryOptimization.jl](https://github.com/RoboticExplorationLab/TrajectoryOptimization.jl).
